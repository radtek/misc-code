	<title>Kernel-Mode Display-Only Miniport Driver</title>
</head>

<body>
	<p>
		This is a sample kernel-mode display-only miniport driver. It implements most of DDIs which display-only drivers should provide to the 
		Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM). The sample can be installed on top of a VESA-capable graphics adapter or on top of a graphics device 
		that supports access to the frame buffer through UEFI.
	</p>
	<p>
		The code is provided mainly as a reference for people writing miniport drivers for display-only devices, although it can also be useful
		for people working on full WDDM drivers to help in display-related DDI implementations.
	</p>
	<p>
		The BltHw.* files are provided only to simulate how the blt operations would work on a real hardware device and should not be used as a 
		basis for actual implementation. The INF file is provided mainly to illustrate how to make the miniport driver visible to other WDDM 
		components.
