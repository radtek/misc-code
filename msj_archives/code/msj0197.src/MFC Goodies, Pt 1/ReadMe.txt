This directory contains the DIBVIEW STEP3 program that accompanies
the article "More Fun with MFC" in the January 1997 issue of
Microsoft Systems Journal.

To use TRACEWIN to view TRACE messages, you must install TRWINDLL.DLL
somewhere in your search path; e.g., \windows\system. Then just run
TRACEWIN.EXE before running DIBVIEW.
