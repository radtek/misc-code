This directory contains two programs, HOOK and DIBVIEW, that
accompany the article "More Fun with MFC" in the January & February
1997 issues of Microsoft Systems Journal.

To compile, type MAKEALL. This batch file builds the debug versions
of HOOK and DIBVIEW in SDI and MDI versions.

To use TRACEWIN to view TRACE messages, you must install TRWINDLL.DLL
somewhere in your search path; e.g., \windows\system. Then just run
TRACEWIN.EXE before running HOOK or DIBVIEW
