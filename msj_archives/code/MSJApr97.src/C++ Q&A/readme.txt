Dear Reader,

The TRACEWIN applet contains two components: TRACEWIN.EXE and
TRWINDLL.DLL. These are built with two separate VC++ project files.

1. Build the DLL (TrWinDll.dll)

2. Build the applet (TraceWin.exe)

When you are done, you should copy the DLL to a directory in your
search path, like C:\WINDOWS
