QUESTION

I've seen some applications with status bar panes that appear out-dented
insted of the normal pushed-in look. Is there an easy way to do this with
MFC?

ANSWER

Yes. MFC supports both styles of status bar panes, as controlled by the
style flags #defined in afxext.h

SBPS_NORMAL     // default (pushed in)
SBPS_POPOUT     // popped-out
SBPS_NOBORDERS  // neither in nor out (like prompt)
SBPS_OWNERDRAW  // you can draw
SBPS_DISABLED   // greyed text
SBPS_STRETCH    // stretch to fill (like prompt)

SBPS_STRETCH and SBPS_NOBORDERS are normally used for the first pane,
which is the prompt ("Ready" indicator). SBPS_STRETCH tells MFC to use all
the space remaining after the other fixed panes have been drawn;
SBPS_NOBORDERS tells MFC to draw the pane with no borders--that is,
neither pushed in nor popped out, but just blended into the background. As
you have already guessed, SBPS_POPOUT tells MFC to draw the panes with the
"popped-out" look you want. So. How do you change the styles?

You can access individual status bar pane styles with
CStatusBar::GetPaneStyle and CStatusBar::SetPaneStyle. For example, to get
the popped-out look, you could add the following lines inside your
CMainFrame::OnCreate function, after you've created the status bar.

CStatusBar *psb = &m_wndStatusBar;
UINT uFlags = psb->GetPaneStyle(ID_MY_PANE);
uFlags |= SBPS_POPOUT;
psb->SetPaneStyle(ID_MY_PANE, uFlags);

You can also do it using the command update mechanism, the same mechanism
MFC uses to let you control the state of menu items and toolbar buttons.
In the case of a status bar pane, if you set the "checked" state, MFC
gives the pane the SBPS_POPOUT style and draws the pane with the
"popped-out" look (Figure [StatusPane.bmp]). This approach is better if
you want to change the pane style dynamically. Figure [StatusPane Program
listing--4 files in FIGS\StatusPane] shows a program I wrote that has menu
commands to let you change whether the status bar panes are pushed in or
popped out. The commands just set a BOOLean variable, m_bStatusBarOut,
which the command update function for the CAPS, NUM and Scroll Lock
indicators then uses to set whether the indicator pane is "checked" or
not.
